# ExchangeRateChecker

Simple application to check the latest exchange rates of different currencies. For now it is USD to RUB.

## Requirements
All you need to use it is to provide an API key to the [ExchangeRateAPI](https://app.exchangerate-api.com) service.
For that, create a new file private.properties in the recourses folder 
and set the variable 'exchangeApiKey' with your own key.
